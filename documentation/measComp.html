    This page is the home of <b>measComp</b>.</p>
  <p>
    <b>measComp</b> supports USB I/O modules from <a href="http://www.mccdaq.com">Measurement
      Computing</a>.</p>
  <p>
    Models supported in <b>measComp</b> include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.mccdaq.com/usb-data-acquisition/USB-CTR08.aspx">USB-CTR08</a>.
      This device is an 8-channel counter/timer module. The driver supports the EPICS
      scaler record with 8 32-bit counters. Counter 0 can be used as a preset counter
      that controls the other 7 counters, the same as the Joerger VSC or the SIS3820.
      The driver also supports using the USB-CTR08 in multi-channel scaler (MCS) mode
      like the SIS3820, with internal or external channel advance and dwell times as short
      as 250 ns. The device also contains 4 programmable pulse generators, and 8 digital
      I/O bits, which are supported with standard EPICS records.</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.mccdaq.com/usb-data-acquisition/USB-1608GX-2AO.aspx">USB-1608GX-2AO</a>.
      analog I/O module. This device contains 16 single-ended/8 differential 16-bit analog
      inputs, 2 16-bit analog outputs, and 8 binary input/outputs. The analog inputs and
      outputs can each be run at 500 kHz. The driver supports simple analog I/O, 2 waveform
      generators using the analog outputs, an 8 or 16 channel waveform digitizer using
      the analog inputs, binary I/O, and a pulse generator.</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.mccdaq.com/usb-data-acquisition/USB-4303.aspx">USB-4303</a>.
      This device is a counter/timer module. It contains 2 9513 counter/timer chips, each
      of which contains 5 16-bit counter/timer units. The driver supports independent
      control of each counter/timer unit, but it also supports the EPICS scaler record
      with 4 32-bit counters, a 16-bit preset timer, and one 16-bit counter. The device
      also contains 8 binary outputs, 8 binary inputs, which are supported with standard
      EPICS bi, bo, longin, and longout records. NOTE: This module is obsolete and is
      no longer be available. Use the USB-CTR08 instead.</li>

  <h2>
    Installation and Building</h2>
  <p>
    After obtaining a copy of the distribution, it must be installed and built for use
    at your site. These steps only need to be performed once for the site (unless versions
    of the module running under different releases of EPICS and/or the other required
    modules are needed).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create an installation directory for the module, usually this will end with<br />
      <br />
      <tt>.../support/</tt>
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Place the distribution file in this directory. Then issue the commands (Unix style)
      <pre>gunzip measCompRX-Y.tar.gz

tar xvf measCompRX-Y.tar
</pre>
      where X-Y is the release.</li>
    <li>This creates a &lt;top&gt; application.<br />
      <pre>.../support/measCompRX-Y
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Edit the <tt>configure/RELEASE</tt> file and set the paths to your installation
      of EPICS base and to your versions of other required support modules.</li>
    <li>Run <tt>gnumake</tt> in the top level directory and check for any compilation
      errors.</li>
    <li>Please email <a href="mailto:rivers@cars.uchicago.edu">Mark Rivers</a> so that
      a record can be kept of which sites are using this software.</li>
  </ol>
