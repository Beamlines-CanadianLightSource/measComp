    This page is the home of <b>measComp</b>.</p>
  <p>
    git <b>measComp</b> supports Ethernet and USB I/O modules from <a href="http://www.mccdaq.com">
      Measurement Computing</a>.</p>
  <p>
    Models supported in <b>measComp</b> include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The USB-CTR08. This device is an 8-channel counter/timer module. The driver supports
      the EPICS scaler record with 8 32-bit counters. Counter 0 can be used as a preset
      counter that controls the other 7 counters, the same as the Joerger VSC or the SIS3820.
      The driver also supports using the USB-CTR08 in multi-channel scaler (MCS) mode
      like the SIS3820, with internal or external channel advance and dwell times as short
      as 250 ns. The device also contains 4 programmable pulse generators, and 8 digital
      I/O bits, which are supported with standard EPICS records.</li>
    <li>The USB-1208LS. analog I/O module. This device contains 8 single-ended/4 differential
      12-bit analog inputs, 2 10-bit analog outputs, a 32-bit counter input, and 16 binary
      input/outputs. The driver supports simple analog I/O, binary I/O, and a counter
      input.</li>
    <li>The USB-1208FS. analog I/O module. This device contains 8 single-ended/4 differential
      12-bit analog inputs, 2 12-bit analog outputs, a 32-bit counter input, and 16 binary
      input/outputs. The driver supports simple analog I/O, binary I/O, and a counter
      input.</li>
    <li>The USB-1608GX-2AO. analog I/O module. This device contains 16 single-ended/8
      differential 16-bit analog inputs, 2 16-bit analog outputs, and 8 binary input/outputs.
      The analog inputs and outputs can each be run at 500 kHz. The driver supports simple
      analog I/O, 2 waveform generators using the analog outputs, an 8 or 16 channel waveform
      digitizer using the analog inputs, binary I/O, 2 counter inputs, and a pulse generator.</li>
    <li>The USB-1608G. analog I/O module. This device contains 16 single-ended/8 differential
      16-bit analog inputs, and 8 binary input/outputs. The analog inputs can be run at
      250 kHz. The driver supports simple analog I/O, an 8 or 16 channel waveform digitizer
      using the analog inputs, binary I/O, 2 counter inputs, and a pulse generator.</li>
    <li>The E-1608 analog I/O module. This is an Ethernet device with 8 single-ended/4
      differential 16-bit analog inputs, 2 16-bit analog outputs, and 8 binary input/outputs.
      The analog inputs can be run at 250 kHz. The driver supports simple analog I/O,
      an 4 or 8 channel waveform digitizer using the analog inputs, binary I/O, and 1
      counter input.</li>
    <li>The USB-231 analog I/O module. This device contains 8 single-ended/4 differential
      16-bit analog inputs, 2 16-bit analog outputs, a 32-bit counter input, and 8 binary
      input/outputs. The driver supports simple analog I/O, binary I/O, and a counter
      input.</li>
    <li>The USB-2408-2AO analog I/O module. This device contains 16 single-ended/8 differential
      24-bit analog inputs, 2 16-bit analog outputs, and 8 binary input/outputs. The analog
      inputs can measure either temperature or voltage. Thermocouple types B, E, J, K,
      N, R, S and T are supported. The analog inputs and outputs can each be run at 1
      kHz. The driver supports simple analog I/O, 2 waveform generators using the analog
      outputs, an 8 or 16 channel waveform digitizer using the analog inputs, binary I/O,
      and 2 counter inputs.</li>
    <li>The E-TC thermocouple module. This is an Ethernet device with 8 24-bit thermopouple
      inputs, a 32-bit counter and 8 binary input/outputs. The driver supports temperature
      measurements at up to 4 Hz, binary I/O, and 1 counter input.</li>
    <li>The TC-32. thermocouple module. This device contains 32 thermocouple inputs, 8
      binary inputs and 32 binary outputs. Thermocouple types B, E, J, K, N, R, S and
      T are supported. The binary outputs can be controlled by the driver or can be configured
      to be an alarm output controlled by the corresponding thermocouple input. USB and
      Ethernet interfaces are both provided, and either can be used.</li>
    <li>The USB-4303. This device is a counter/timer module. It contains 2 9513 counter/timer
      chips, each of which contains 5 16-bit counter/timer units. The driver supports
      independent control of each counter/timer unit, but it also supports the EPICS scaler
      record with 4 32-bit counters, a 16-bit preset timer, and one 16-bit counter. The
      device also contains 8 binary outputs, 8 binary inputs, which are supported with
      standard EPICS bi, bo, longin, and longout records. NOTE: This module is obsolete
      and is no longer be available. Use the USB-CTR08 instead.</li>

  <p>
    The required versions of each of the above modules for a specific release of measComp
    can be determined from the measComp/configure/RELEASE file.</p>
  <h2>
    Installation and Building</h2>
  <p>
    After obtaining a copy of the distribution, it must be installed and built for use
    at your site. These steps only need to be performed once for the site (unless versions
    of the module running under different releases of EPICS and/or the other required
    modules are needed).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create an installation directory for the module, usually this will end with<br />
      <br />
      <tt>.../support/</tt>
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Place the distribution file in this directory. Then issue the commands (Unix style)
      <pre>gunzip measCompRX-Y.tar.gz

tar xvf measCompRX-Y.tar
</pre>
      where X-Y is the release.</li>
    <li>This creates a &lt;top&gt; application.<br />
      <pre>.../support/measCompRX-Y
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Edit the <tt>configure/RELEASE</tt> file and set the paths to your installation
      of EPICS base and to your versions of other required support modules.</li>
    <li>Run <tt>gnumake</tt> in the top level directory and check for any compilation
      errors.</li>
    <li>Please email <a href="mailto:rivers@cars.uchicago.edu">Mark Rivers</a> so that
      a record can be kept of which sites are using this software.</li>
  </ol>
