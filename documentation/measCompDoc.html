    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This package provides EPICS drivers for the some of the USB I/O modules from Measurement
    Computing. Currently the USB-CTR04/08 and USB-4303 counter/timer, and multi-function
    modules (USB-1208LS, USB-1608GX-2A0, USB-2408-2A0, TC-32) are supported. The multi-function
    modules support analog input/output (not TC-32), temperature input (USB-2408-2A0
    and TC-32), digital input/output, pulse counters (not TC-32), and pulse generators
    (USB-1608GX-2A0 only) These drivers are documented separately.</p>

    This module is currently only supported on Windows, with the win32-x86, win32-x66-static,
    windows-x64, windows-x64-static, and cygwin-x86 EPICS architectures. The driver
    uses the Measurement Computing "Universal Library", which is only available on Windows.
    Note that there is Linux support for many Measurement Computing devices available,
    including all of those supported in this module, from <a href="ftp://lx10.tx.ncsu.edu/pub/Linux/drivers">
      Warren J. Jasper at North Carolina State University (NCSU).</a>. However, the
    API is completely different from the Universal Library, and these drivers only run
    on Linux, not Windows. They also do not support some of the high-performance streaming
    features of the Windows drivers. It would certainly be possible to write EPICS drivers
    for Linux using these low-level drivers from NCSU.</p>
